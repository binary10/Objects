# Basics 

* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance



# OO Principles

* Encapsulate what varies.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Program to interfaces, not implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
* Only talk to your friends.
* Don’t call us, we’ll call you.
* A class should have only one reason to change.
